## [Loan Calculator GUI](https://github.com/TonyAlarcon/CS-55-Java-Porgramming-/blob/master/Loan%20Calculator%20GUI/GUI%20Loan%20Cal.java)
```
 Program ascertains monthly loan payment and displays an amortization schedule give the loan attributes which
 are entered by the user. Equation below is utilized:
```
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\textup{Monthly&space;Payment}&space;=&space;[&space;\textup{Rate}&space;&plus;&space;\textup{Rate}/&space;(&space;[&space;1&space;&plus;&space;\textup{Rate&space;}]^{months}&space;-&space;1&space;)]&space;*&space;\textup{Principal}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\textup{Monthly&space;Payment}&space;=&space;[&space;\textup{Rate}&space;&plus;&space;\textup{Rate}/&space;(&space;[&space;1&space;&plus;&space;\textup{Rate&space;}]^{months}&space;-&space;1&space;)]&space;*&space;\textup{Principal}" title="\textup{Monthly Payment} = [ \textup{Rate} + \textup{Rate}/ ( [ 1 + \textup{Rate }]^{months} - 1 )] * \textup{Principal}" /></a>

## [Coffee Menu](https://github.com/TonyAlarcon/CS-55-Java-Porgramming-/tree/master/HowToMakeCoffee)
```
Program that manages coffees. 
This algorithm repeatedly shows the user a menu to create one of the three
mocha drinks or to print all the drinks created so far. If the user selects to 
create a new mocha drink, the program prompts the user to enter the ingredients 
of the selected drink. If the user selects to print the current coffees, print the 
drink type and ingredients of each drink to the console. Creating objects for testing all 
classes and all functions in the main function.

## [Shapes](https://github.com/TonyAlarcon/CS-55-Java-Porgramming-/blob/master/Shapes.java)
```
This program repeatedly shows the user a menu to create one of the three main 
shapes or to print the shapes created so far. If the user selects to create a new shape, 
the program prompts the user to enter the values for the size of the selected shape. 
The shape is then stored in an array. If the user selects to print the current shapes, 
print the name and the total area of each shape to the console.
